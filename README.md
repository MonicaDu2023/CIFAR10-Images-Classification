# CIFAR10-Images-Classification

## Description
The CIFAR10 small photo classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning. CIFAR is an acronym that stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research and the CIFAR-10 dataset was developed along with the CIFAR-100 dataset by researchers at the CIFAR institute.

The dataset is comprised of 60,000 32×32 pixel color photographs of objects from 10 classes, such as frogs, birds, cats, ships, etc.

## Libraries
python 3.7.1 pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, livelossplot, torch, torchvision
## OverView
In this Project, I create an image classification system that can determine the image’s class, which implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifiers using GPU-enabled Pytorch. 
The project is divided into several steps:
* Load dataset
* Data Analysis and Visialization
* Model Built (Convolution - Activation Function - Pooling - Fully Connected Layer - Dense Layer)
* Train and Perforance Tuning
* Evaluation

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
To compute the output size of a given convolutional layer we performed calculation taken from Stanford's cs231n course
